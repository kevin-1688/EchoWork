Rewrite the input as a reusable template.

Guidelines:
- Keep the original tone (formal / casual / direct)
- Remove unnecessary emotion or repetition
- Replace specific details with clear placeholders
  Examples:
  - [Client Name]
  - [Project Name]
  - [Price]
  - [Deadline]

The result should be something the user can copy and reuse
with minimal editing.
